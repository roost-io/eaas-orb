description: To use the kube config you get from triggering EAAS in another job, you want to make use of workspaces, the orb will export the required kubeconfig as an environment variable, which can be used across jobs with the use of workspaces. if you want to use the kube config in the same job where you used the command, you can simply use the environment variable.
